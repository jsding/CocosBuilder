## Getting started with the source

 Just Build & Run CocosBuilder/CocosBuilder.xcodeproj 


## Still having trouble compiling CocosBuilder?

It is most likely still a problem with the submodules(also don't forget to recursively checkout submodules). Edit the .git/config file and remove the lines that are referencing submodules. Then change directory into the top directory and run:

    git submodule update --init

When building CocosBuilder, make sure that "CocosBuilder" is the selected target (it may be some of the plug-in targets by default).
